    <h2>By Willard Carroll Smith</h2>

  <p>
  In West Philadelphia, born and raised on the playground is where I spent most of my days:
    <ul>
      <li>Chilling out</li>
      <li>Maxing</li>
      <li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  I was shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys <strong>they were up to no good</strong> started making trouble in my neighborhood.

  I got in <em>one little fight</em> and my mom got scared. She said,
  <blockquote>You'll move in with your Auntie and your Uncle in Bel-Air.</blockquote>
